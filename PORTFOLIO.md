# BCI Intelligence Portfolio
## Manav Davis — Blackrock Neurotech Application

---

## Executive Summary

I built two AI-powered intelligence tools to support Blackrock Neurotech's commercialization of **Neuralace** — demonstrating how AI can accelerate market research and business development in the BCI industry.

**Total Build Time:** ~2 hours  
**Lines of Research:** 15,000+  
**Indexed Documents:** 200+ chunks  
**Key Insight Generated:** Actionable regulatory roadmap for Neuralace

---

## The Problem

Neuralace is unprecedented: a 10,000+ channel, brain-conforming neural interface targeting vision restoration and mental health treatment. There's no regulatory playbook for this.

**Questions I set out to answer:**
1. What FDA pathway should Neuralace pursue?
2. Who are the competitors and what can we learn from them?
3. How does Blackrock get Medicare to pay for this?
4. Which research labs should Blackrock partner with?
5. What does the academic literature say about biocompatibility, visual prostheses, and mental health BCIs?

## What I Built

### Tool 1: BCI Regulatory Pathway Navigator

**Purpose:** Navigate FDA pathways for BCI devices

**Deliverables:**
- 6 comprehensive research documents
- 4 structured JSON databases
- Working Python CLI with semantic search

**Key Finding:** Precision Neuroscience cleared 510(k) in 31 days by limiting claims to temporary use. Blackrock can replicate this for Neuralace hardware.

**Strategic Recommendation:** 
```
Q2 2025: Submit Neuralace research 510(k) (hardware only)
Q3 2025: Submit MoveAgain IDE
2026: Engage CMS TCET pathway
2028: Commercial launch aligned with FDA + Medicare
```

### Tool 2: BCI Literature Intelligence Agent

**Purpose:** Track research papers, labs, and collaboration targets

**Deliverables:**
- 5 topic-specific research summaries
- Database of 18+ leading BCI research labs
- Key researcher profiles

**Key Insight:** UCSF Starr Lab is pioneering depression DBS with personalized closed-loop systems — directly relevant to Neuralace mental health applications. This is a potential collaboration target.

## Key Research Findings

### 1. Regulatory Landscape

| Pathway | Best For | Timeline | Neuralace Fit |
|---------|----------|----------|---------------|
| 510(k) | Hardware only, temporary use | 90 days | ✅ Research device |
| De Novo | Novel low-risk devices | 150 days | ✅ Possible for full system |
| PMA | High-risk therapeutic devices | 3-5 years | ⚠️ Clinical BCI |
| TCET | Medicare coverage | 6 months post-FDA | ✅ Breakthrough eligible |

### 2. Competitive Intelligence

**Precision Neuroscience** achieved what everyone thought impossible: a 510(k) clearance for a high-channel cortical interface. Their strategy:
1. Use existing predicates (Ad-Tech subdural electrodes)
2. Limit claims to temporary use (<30 days)
3. Position as enhanced version of existing tech

**Implication:** Blackrock can do the same for Neuralace hardware while pursuing PMA for the full therapeutic system.

### 3. Reimbursement Breakthrough

**IpsiHand** became the first BCI with dedicated CMS coverage (January 2025):
- Classified as Durable Medical Equipment
- Got dedicated CPT code
- Sets precedent for BCI reimbursement

**TCET Pathway** (August 2024) is a game-changer:
- Expedited Medicare coverage for Breakthrough devices
- MoveAgain qualifies
- Target: Coverage decision 6 months after FDA approval

### 4. Neuralace-Specific Insights

**Visual Prosthesis (2028 target):**
- Competitor: Cortigent Orion (60 electrodes, FDA Breakthrough)
- Key collaborator: UCLA Visual Prosthesis Lab
- Regulatory path: IDE → PMA with Breakthrough benefits

**Mental Health (Depression/Anxiety):**
- Different FDA pathway than motor BCIs
- Placebo control challenges in trial design
- Key collaborator: UCSF Starr Lab (personalized closed-loop DBS)

## Technical Demonstration

Both tools are fully functional Python applications:

```bash
# Regulatory Navigator
python cli.py search "Medicare TCET pathway"
> Found 5 results:
> 1. TCET provides expedited national coverage for FDA Breakthrough Devices...
> 2. MoveAgain qualifies for TCET via Breakthrough Designation (Nov 2021)...

# Literature Agent  
python cli.py lab ucsf-starr
> Starr Lab - Movement Disorders (UCSF)
> Focus: Closed-loop DBS for depression
> Key Achievement: Personalized depression treatment
> Neuralace Relevance: HIGH - Mental health BCI pathway
```

## Why This Matters for Blackrock

### Immediate Value
- **Regulatory roadmap** ready for leadership review
- **Competitive analysis** identifying strategic gaps
- **Collaboration targets** for BD outreach
- **Reimbursement strategy** aligned with TCET

### Demonstrated Capabilities
- Rapid synthesis of complex regulatory landscape
- Ability to build functional tools, not just reports
- Understanding of BCI industry dynamics
- Bridge between technical and business perspectives

### Future Potential
These tools can evolve into:
- Real-time FDA monitoring dashboard
- Automated literature alerts
- Investor-ready market analysis
- QMS-integrated regulatory tracking

## About Me

**Manav Davis**  
Brown University, Economics '25

I combine quantitative analytical training with technical building capabilities. I don't just research — I build tools that scale.

**Why Blackrock:**
Neuralace isn't just a product — it's a platform for treating conditions that affect millions. I want to help make that real by ensuring the business and regulatory foundations are as strong as the technology.
