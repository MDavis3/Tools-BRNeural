# Mental Health Neuromodulation for BCI: Depression & Anxiety

## Executive Summary
Blackrock has identified treatment of mental health disorders like depression and anxiety as key future applications for Neuralace. This report summarizes the current state of neuromodulation for psychiatric conditions and opportunities for high-channel BCIs.

## The Unmet Need

### Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD)
- **30%** of depression patients don't respond to multiple medications
- **~10 million** Americans with TRD
- Existing options: ECT, TMS, ketamine - all have limitations
- **Market opportunity:** Multi-billion dollar unmet need

### Anxiety Disorders
- **40 million** Americans affected
- Often comorbid with depression
- Limited neuromodulation research compared to depression
- Emerging as target for closed-loop systems

## Current Neuromodulation Approaches

### 1. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)
**Approved uses:** Parkinson's, essential tremor, OCD (humanitarian exemption)
**Depression research status:** Multiple clinical trials ongoing

**Brain Targets for Depression:**
| Target | Abbreviation | Trials | Results |
|--------|--------------|--------|---------|
| Subcallosal cingulate | SCC/Area 25 | Multiple | 40-60% response at 1 year |
| Ventral capsule/striatum | VC/VS | Several | 50% response |
| Nucleus accumbens | NAcc | Several | 50% response |
| Medial forebrain bundle | MFB | Early | Rapid response |
| Anterior cingulate cortex | ACC | New 2025 | Promising preclinical |

### 2. Abbott TRANSCEND Trial (2024-Present)
**Landmark study for depression DBS**

**Details:**
- First pivotal trial for depression DBS since failed Broaden study
- 500 patients planned
- SCC target with Abbott Infinity system
- 3-year follow-up
- First implant at Mount Sinai (March 2025)

**Key innovations:**
- Better patient selection criteria
- Improved surgical targeting with tractography
- Longer optimization period before assessment

**Why it matters for Neuralace:**
- If TRANSCEND succeeds, establishes DBS for depression
- Creates regulatory pathway for neural interfaces in psychiatry
- Validates market for mental health BCIs

### 3. Closed-Loop / Adaptive DBS
**The future of psychiatric neuromodulation**

**Concept:** Detect biomarkers of depression/anxiety in real-time, stimulate only when needed

**UCSF Closed-Loop Study (Ongoing)**
- Recording from OFC and amygdala
- Detecting depression biomarkers
- Adaptive stimulation based on mood state
- Early results show symptom-specific patterns

**2022 Breakthrough:** (Nature Medicine)
- Patient with severe depression
- Detected personalized biomarker in amygdala
- Closed-loop stimulation achieved remission
- "Proof of concept" for personalized psychiatry

## Why Neuralace Could Transform Mental Health Treatment

### Current DBS Limitations
1. **Few channels:** Typically 4-8 contacts per lead
2. **Fixed stimulation:** Continuous, not adaptive
3. **Limited recording:** Poor signal resolution
4. **Invasive:** Deep brain penetration required

### Neuralace Advantages
1. **10,000+ channels:** Map entire circuits, not single points
2. **Bidirectional:** Record AND stimulate
3. **Surface placement:** Less invasive than deep probes
4. **Flexible/conformable:** Better chronic stability
5. **AI integration:** Learn individual patterns over time

### Potential Paradigm Shift
**From:** "Stimulate one spot continuously"
**To:** "Map entire mood circuit, stimulate precisely when and where needed"

## Brain Circuits Implicated in Depression/Anxiety

### Key Structures
```
Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)
├── Dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) - cognitive control, TMS target
├── Ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) - emotion regulation
├── Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) - reward processing
└── Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) - error monitoring, mood

Limbic Structures
├── Amygdala - fear, threat detection
├── Hippocampus - memory, context
├── Nucleus accumbens - reward, motivation
└── Insula - interoception, emotional awareness

Subcortical
├── Thalamus - relay, integration
├── Habenula - disappointment, failure processing
└── Ventral tegmental area - dopamine, reward
```

### Depression Network (Mayberg Model)
Depression involves dysregulation across distributed network:
- **Overactive:** Subgenual ACC (Area 25), amygdala
- **Underactive:** DLPFC, dorsal ACC
- **Abnormal connectivity:** Between prefrontal and limbic regions

### Anxiety Circuits
- Amygdala hyperactivity
- Reduced PFC regulation
- Aberrant interoceptive processing (insula)

## Neuralace Strategy for Mental Health

### Phase 1: Recording/Biomarker Discovery (2024-2026)
- Deploy Neuralace in epilepsy monitoring patients
- Record from cortical mood circuits
- Identify depression/anxiety biomarkers
- Build database of neural signatures

### Phase 2: Closed-Loop Development (2026-2028)
- Develop real-time biomarker detection algorithms
- Test responsive stimulation protocols in animal models
- Partner with UCSF/Mount Sinai psychiatric DBS groups
- Apply for IDE for psychiatric indication

### Phase 3: Clinical Translation (2028-2030)
- First-in-human trials for treatment-resistant depression
- Leverage TRANSCEND pathway if successful
- Position as "next-generation" psychiatric interface

## Key Research Collaborations

### Critical Partners
1. **Philip Starr (UCSF)** - Closed-loop DBS pioneer
2. **Brian Kopell (Mount Sinai)** - TRANSCEND trial lead
3. **Andrew Krystal (UCSF)** - Depression biomarkers
4. **Katherine Scangos (UCSF)** - Personalized closed-loop study

### Academic Collaborations
- UCSF Dolby Family Center for Mood Disorders
- Stanford Mood Disorders Center
- NIH BRAIN Initiative mental health projects

## Regulatory Pathway

### FDA Considerations
1. **Depression is challenging indication:**
   - Subjective outcomes
   - High placebo response
   - Previous failed trials (Broaden)

2. **Potential pathways:**
   - Humanitarian Device Exemption (like OCD DBS)
   - Follow TRANSCEND if successful
   - Breakthrough Device designation (likely eligible)

3. **Endpoints:**
   - MADRS/HAM-D depression scales
   - Quality of life measures
   - Biomarker-based endpoints (novel)

### Timeline Estimate
- 2024-2026: Preclinical/biomarker work
- 2026-2027: Pre-IDE meetings with FDA
- 2027-2028: IDE submission
- 2028-2030: First-in-human trials
- 2032+: Potential approval

## Competitive Landscape

### Inner Cosmos
- "Digital pill" for depression
- Less invasive (skull-mounted stimulator)
- Lower efficacy expectations
- FDA IDE approved 2022

### Abbott/Medtronic/Boston Scientific
- Established DBS companies
- TRANSCEND (Abbott) is key competition
- Have regulatory expertise, reimbursement relationships

### Potential Advantages for Blackrock
- Higher channel count = better mapping
- Bidirectional = closed-loop ready
- Surface placement = less invasive than DBS
- Flexible = chronic stability

## Key Metrics for Success

| Parameter | Current DBS | Neuralace Target |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
