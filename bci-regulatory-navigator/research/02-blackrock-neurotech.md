- Prosthetic devices

#### System Components
1. **Implanted Array:** NeuroPort-based electrode array in motor cortex
2. **Signal Processor:** Decodes intended movement from neuronal activity
3. **Wireless Transmitter:** External communication unit
4. **Control Software:** Translates brain signals to device commands

#### Regulatory Status

| Milestone | Date | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **FDA Breakthrough Device Designation** | November 16, 2021 | ✅ Granted |
| FDA Submission Planned | 2022 | Announced |
| Commercial Launch Target | 2023 | Originally planned |
| Current Status | 2025 | Pursuing regulatory approval |

#### FDA Breakthrough Designation Details
- **Designation Date:** November 16, 2021
- **Significance:** Among first BCI implants to receive Breakthrough designation
- **Benefits Obtained:**
  - Priority FDA review
  - Enhanced FDA interaction
  - Expedited development pathway

#### Target Patient Population
- Approximately **5.35 million Americans** live with paralysis
- Target conditions:
  - Tetraplegia (spinal cord injury)
  - ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)
  - Stroke
  - Other central nervous system disorders

#### Regulatory Pathway Strategy
Given Breakthrough designation, likely pathway is:
1. **IDE for pivotal clinical trial**
2. **PMA or De Novo** depending on classification negotiation
3. Leverage extensive NeuroPort safety data
4. 25+ years of clinical research as safety evidence

### 3. Neuralace (Next-Generation BCI)

**Ultra-High Channel Count Flexible Neural Interface**

#### Unveiled: November 2022 at Society for Neuroscience

#### Technical Innovation
- **10,000+ channels** (vs 96-128 for current arrays)
- **Flexible, lace-structured design**
- Thinner than an eyelash
- Conforms to brain surface fissures and sulci

#### Key Features
1. **Scalable Architecture:** Entire system integrated on flexible chip
2. **Enhanced Biocompatibility:** Porous form factor allows natural tissue integration
3. **Reduced Immune Response:** Permits flow of cellular fluids and biomolecules
4. **Whole-Brain Data Capture:** Orders of magnitude more data than existing electrodes

#### Clinical Rationale
- Current BCIs with ~600 channels enable sophisticated motor control
- 10,000+ channels could enable:
  - Vision restoration
  - Memory enhancement
  - Mental health treatment (depression, anxiety)
  - Performance prediction
  - More natural, intuitive control

#### Development Timeline
| Milestone | Target Date |
|-----------|-------------|
| Neuroscience research tool availability | 2024 |
| First-in-human visual prosthesis demonstration | 2028 |
| Commercial clinical applications | TBD |

#### Regulatory Considerations for Neuralace
- Novel form factor will require new regulatory strategy
- Potential pathways:
  1. **De Novo** if positioned as new device type
  2. **510(k)** if positioned as enhanced cortical electrode
  3. **IDE → PMA** for closed-loop therapeutic applications

#### April 2025 Research Publication
- BioRxiv preprint: "Neuralace: Manufacture, Parylene-C Coating, and Mechanical Properties"
- Documents manufacturing process
- Demonstrates Parylene-C biocompatible coating
- Characterizes mechanical properties for subdural implantation
