2. **Mental Health:** NIMH, Mass General, Columbia
3. **BCI Research:** BrainGate consortium, Caltech

---

## Phase 2: Visual Prosthesis Clinical Development (2026-2028)

### Why Visual Prosthesis First?

1. **Clearer Regulatory Pathway:** Orion/Argus II established precedent
2. **HDE Eligibility:** Small patient population (<8,000/year)
3. **Demonstrable Efficacy:** Phosphene perception is measurable
4. **Ethical Approval:** Blind patients strongly motivated

### Competitive Landscape - Visual Prosthesis

| Company | Device | Channels | Status | Neuralace Advantage |
|---------|--------|----------|--------|---------------------|
| Cortigent | Orion | 60 | IDE trial | **166x more resolution** |
| Second Sight | Argus II | 60 | Discontinued | Market opportunity |
| Pixium | PRIMA | 378 | EU approved | US opportunity |

**Key Insight:** No high-channel cortical visual prosthesis exists. Neuralace would be **first-in-class**.

### IDE Strategy

#### Pre-Submission Meeting (Q-Sub)
**Request from FDA:**
1. Confirm visual prosthesis device classification
2. Discuss predicate/reference devices (Orion, Argus II)
3. Negotiate clinical study design
4. Clarify HDE vs PMA pathway

#### Preclinical Studies Required
| Study | Purpose | Timeline |
|-------|---------|----------|
| ISO 10993 Biocompatibility | Long-term implant safety | 12 months |
| IEC 60601-1 Electrical Safety | Device safety standards | 6 months |
| Non-Human Primate Efficacy | Proof of concept | 18 months |
| Chronic Implant Durability | Longevity testing | 24 months |

#### Early Feasibility Study Design
- **Population:** 6-10 patients with severe blindness
- **Implant Site:** Visual cortex (V1)
- **Primary Endpoint:** Safety (SAEs at 12 months)
- **Secondary Endpoints:** 
  - Phosphene perception threshold
  - Object localization
  - Navigation tasks
- **Follow-up:** 5 years minimum

### Timeline to First Human Implant

| Milestone | Target Date |
|-----------|-------------|
| Pre-Submission Meeting | Q1 2026 |
| Preclinical Package Complete | Q2 2026 |
| IDE Submission | Q3 2026 |
| IDE Approval | Q4 2026 |
| **First Patient Implant** | **Q1 2027** |
| Early Feasibility Complete | Q4 2028 |

---

## Phase 3: Visual Prosthesis Approval (2029-2031)

### Recommended Pathway: Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE)

**Rationale:**
- US population with cortical blindness: ~3,000-5,000
- Well under 8,000/year HDE threshold
- Precedent: Argus II HDE H110002

**HDE Advantages:**
✅ No effectiveness requirement  
✅ Faster than PMA (75 days vs 180+ days)  
✅ Lower evidence burden  
✅ Enables commercial distribution

**HDE Process:**
1. Submit HDE application with EFS safety data
2. FDA review (75-day goal)
3. Approval for specific indication
4. IRB approval required at each implanting site
5. Post-approval study possible

### Reimbursement Strategy

**TCET Pathway (Critical):**
1. Apply for Breakthrough Device Designation (NOW)
2. Request TCET participation after IDE approval
3. CMS Early Evidence Preview during clinical development
4. Target NCD within 6 months of HDE approval

**Benefit Category:**
- Likely: Prosthetic device (SSA § 1861(s)(8))
- Precedent: Cochlear implants, retinal prostheses

---

## Phase 4: Mental Health Applications (2030+)

### Target Indications

#### 1. Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD)
- **Population:** ~3 million US patients
- **Pathway:** PMA (too large for HDE)
- **Challenge:** DBS trials failed—must differentiate

**Neuralace Differentiation:**
- Higher resolution enables precise targeting
- Flexible form factor reduces tissue damage
- Potential for closed-loop adaptive stimulation

#### 2. Severe Treatment-Resistant OCD
- **Population:** ~50,000 US patients
- **Pathway:** HDE (precedent: DBS HDE 2009)
- **Advantage:** Smaller population, established pathway

### Mental Health Regulatory Strategy

**Learn from DBS Failures:**
1. BROADEN trial (depression) failed at primary endpoint
2. RECLAIM trial (depression) failed at primary endpoint
3. **Root cause:** Poor patient selection, suboptimal targeting

**Neuralace Approach:**
1. Start with severe, treatment-resistant cases
2. Use high-resolution mapping to identify targets
3. Adaptive stimulation based on neural feedback
4. Careful biomarker-based patient selection

### Timeline

| Indication | IDE Target | Approval Target |
|------------|------------|-----------------|
| Visual Prosthesis | 2026 | 2031 |
| Treatment-Resistant OCD | 2030 | 2035 |
| Treatment-Resistant Depression | 2032 | 2038 |
