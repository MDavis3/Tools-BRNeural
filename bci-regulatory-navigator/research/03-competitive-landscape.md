| 510(k) Submission | February 27, 2025 | K242618 |
| **FDA Clearance** | **March 30, 2025** | **Class II, Product Code GYC** |

#### Regulatory Strategy Analysis

**How Precision Achieved 510(k) Clearance:**

1. **Predicate Selection**
   - **Primary:** Ad-Tech Subdural Electrodes (K191186) - same regulation, identical intended use
   - **Reference:** NeuroOne Evo Cortical Electrode (K192764) - demonstrates FDA familiarity with polyimide arrays

2. **Classification Strategy**
   - Fit within existing 21 CFR 882.1310 (Cortical Electrode)
   - Class II, Product Code GYC
   - Avoided Class III by limiting claims

3. **Limited Intended Use**
   - Temporary implantation (<30 days only)
   - Recording, monitoring, and stimulation on brain surface
   - Open craniotomy or burr-hole procedures
   - **NOT** claimed for permanent implant or closed-loop control

4. **Testing Package**
   - ISO 10993 biocompatibility (≤30 day implantables)
   - IEC 60601-1/-1-2 electrical safety & EMC
   - Flex-fatigue & tensile tests (>1 million cycles)
   - Porcine 1-week and 6-week subdural studies
   - EtO sterilization validation (ISO 11135)
   - Packaging shelf-life (ASTM D4169)

5. **Pre-Submission Engagement**
   - Q-Sub negotiated classification, predicate, test matrix
   - FDA agreement before expensive studies

**Result:** Cleared in ~31 days after submission (Feb 27 → Mar 30, 2025)

**Key Lessons for Blackrock:**
- Limiting claims enables faster 510(k) pathway
- Leverage existing predicate ecosystem
- Pre-submission engagement critical
- Hardware-first strategy allows staged approach

**Future Expansion:**
- Current clearance = hardware only
- Software decoding algorithms need separate submission
- Permanent BCI/closed-loop claims require IDE → PMA or De Novo
